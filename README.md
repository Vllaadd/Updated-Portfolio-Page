# Updated-Portfolio-Page

# Overview 
This is my Portfolio Page. 
This version is an upgrade from the original page which was a mock portfolio of a skateboard store owner. 
It was more of a practice of CSS. In this version I implemented my picture and my projects and also added a fade-in on scroll effect. 

This Portfolio is not final and I will keep on adding more features and animations in the comming weeks.
